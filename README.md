# Morse
<p>This is a simple aplication implemented in C++.</p>
<p>It is a translator from morse code to normal readable text and viceversa. 
It also serves as a Braile translator because both morse and braile are identical in the alfanumeric characters and puntuation sings.
The interface is pretty simple: You can either encode or decode morse messages, and you can choose to do it from a file or from the terminal itself.</p>
