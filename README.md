# Morse
<p>This is a simple aplication implemented in C++.</p>
<p>It is a translator from morse code to normal readable text and viceversa.</p>
<p>The interface is pretty simple: You can either encode or decode morse messages, and you can choose to do it from a file or from the terminal itself.</p>
<p>It is silly, unprofesionall, and made purely for the sake of learning and improving my skills. So don't take it very seriously.</p>

##How it works
The saulv::Morse class uses a Binary Tree to decode morse text.
